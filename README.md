# ZWEGAT Stock Predictions üí∏

ZWEGAT is my learning project for financial data analysis and "Long short-term Memory predictions" based off historical stock data. It's named after the famous German debt counselor [Peter Zwegat](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Zwegat).

## Important note üìù

This project should not be used in any production environment as my knowledge of machine learning and financial advisory is not good enough to actually produce usable results. However, if you're also trying to learn about these topics, feel free to adapt this project and play around with it's results.
